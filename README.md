# Breeze Presentation Tool

This will become the template we use for developing Breeze Presentations. The framework is based upon Reveal.js, which consists of HTML, markdown and javascript.  The tool is a light weight solution for developing and delivering quality presentations in a very flexible manner.  This is a widely adopted practice within the Open Source community for delivering presentations, training and information for end users.

We will use this toold for internal, as well as external presentations, training and informaation to our user community.

Thanks for being here!
